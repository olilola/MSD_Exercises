Project Planning Task - Cost and Time estimation
You have been approached to develop a new mobile software to collect
data from sensors. The top of the application provides a select box with
which the user could select a sensor. After selecting the sensor, the Add
button will be pushed and the sensor is added to the list in the middle.
The user could select several sensors. If the an added sensor is already in
the list, the Add operation will be ignored. A selected sensor in the list
could be marked. If the Remove button is pushed, the marked sensor will
be removed from the list. If the start button is pushed, the application
will start collecting data from the selected sensors. At the same time, the
start button will change the label to Stop. While collecting data, adding
or removing sensors is not possible. After pushing the Stop button, the
collected data will be sent to a backend service.

Provide an estimation of cost and time to implement that
software.
