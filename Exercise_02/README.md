Usage: python gccompute.py <input_file_fasta>

Programming Task - Computing GC Content
The drug Theralizumab is interacting with the Gene CD28.
Unfortunately, the first in human study ended up a disaster.
Take a look on that interesting story
You have been approached to write a small piece of software, to
analyze gene information.
The GC-content of a DNA string is given by the percentage of
symbols in the string that are ’C’ or ’G’.
Given: A DNA sequence in FASTA format.
Return: GC-content value for the given sequence.
