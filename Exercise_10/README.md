Data Analytics Task - Digital Biomarker Scientific Question
The Sensor Data Collection App provides a way to collect data from
various sensors. Now it is time to think about a scientifc question which
should be answered with that data.
Here are some examples:
▶ Does the medication XY lead to a lack of exercise?
▶ Does the medication XY cause people to lose their balance and fall
to the ground more often?
▶ Does Parkinson disease gets worse over time?
▶ ...
Now think about how this question could be answered. Which data is
needed? How to interpret the data?
Use the Sensor Data Collection App and create some sample data files
which will be used for the analysis.
Use Python or R to analyze the data.
Prepare a 3 slide presentation with:
▶ What is your scientific question?
▶ Which sensors are used to collect the data?
▶ How does the analytics part look like?
