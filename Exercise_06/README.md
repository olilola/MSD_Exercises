Usage: python3 dna2protein.py

Use the following Python code: dna2protein.py
1. Translate the given DNA sequence into a protein sequence by
using the given code (transcribe_dna_to_rna and

2. Create a utility class, which contains both methods as static
methods.
3. Store the sequence into an object of the class
SequenceStorage.
4. Change the class SequenceStorage in a way that only one
object could exist. Which design pattern could be used?
5. Create a random sequence with the DNASequenceGenerator.
6. Now there is a new requirement. Your program should also
work with protein sequences. Extend the code to make that
possible.
7. Create a class SequenceFactory, which contains a method
to create a sequence. Based on a given flag, the sequence will
be a DNA or protein sequence.
